00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hi, I'm Amanda from Loom, and in this video I'm going to show you how to get started with using Loom.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
First, an introduction to our recorders. My personal favorite and daily recorder is our Desktop app,

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
mainly because it has helpful features like HD recording as well as custom size recording.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Also, can't forget our drawing tool.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You can use our Chrome extension for integrations like Zendesk, Slack, and Gmail,

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and it's also handy for sharing recordings directly through Chrome.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,000
If you're recording on the go, you can download our mobile app, which is available for iOS and Android devices.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Before you get started with the Desktop app, you're going to want to take a look at your different capture options.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Starting with your camera, so you can see I'm recording with my screen and camera.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
This is my preferred method of recording. If you want to record just your screen, you'd select Screen Only,

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and if you want to record just yourself, you'd select Cam Only.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Now, this might seem a bit obvious, but you're also going to want to make sure that your microphone is working.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So you'll have the option to select your microphone here, and one easy way to test that your audio is working

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
is by seeing if the microphone icon is responding.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Lastly, I wanted to take a minute to point out your preferences,

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
which you can find at the upper right-hand corner when you click on these three dots.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Your preferences will take you to your settings, which will allow you to turn certain features on and off,

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
like your default quality when you're recording, as well as your highlight mouse clicks.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Lastly, your keyboard shortcuts are in here as well, and they are entirely customizable.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Once you're ready to start recording, you'll be prompted by a countdown to help you gather your thoughts.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I also want to point out that I'm using our recording canvas, and if you click on your camera bubble,

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
you'll see the option to select a background and frame. This is my favorite one.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
These come in handy if you want to make your video just a bit more engaging or fun.

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
On the left-hand side, you'll see the recording buttons. First, we have the Restart button.

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
This comes in handy if you want to quickly restart your video without exiting out of Loom.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Next, we have the Pause button, which is another personal favorite feature.

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
This comes in handy if you want to gather your thoughts without stopping the video entirely.

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
As you can see, you can pick up right where you left off, and people will be none the wiser.

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Lastly, we have the Cancel button. This is if you want to completely scrap your video and start over.

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And as I showed you earlier, we have the drawing tool, which allows you to highlight things on your screen.

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Once you're ready to stop recording, you'll hit the Stop Recording button,

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
and this will take you to the Share page to continue editing your video.

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Once you've stopped recording, you'll be taken to the Video Share page,

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
where you can make edits and change the privacy settings of your video.

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:55,000
The first thing you might want to do is edit the title of your video to make it a bit more engaging or personalized.

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
If you look on the right-hand side, you'll also see the option to edit your video preferences.

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So this will give you options to turn on comments or emoji reactions, depending on the type of video that you're sending.

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Say you were recording your video and you made a mistake, or maybe at the beginning you needed to take a breather before getting started.

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You can trim your video to make sure it looks as polished as possible before sending it off.

40
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Lastly, if you're on the Education, Business, or Enterprise plans, you'll see the options to edit a call to action.

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:39,000
This is great if you want to share a presentation or Google Slides for someone to check out after watching your video.

42
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And adding a custom thumbnail can also help make your video look a bit more polished.

43
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So now you've finished editing your video, the easiest way to share it with people is to click the Copy Link button here.

44
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You'll be able to share these links with anyone that you want.

45
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Say you want to make sure that you have some privacy settings on your video.

46
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
When you click on the Share button, you'll see the options to edit the privacy settings.

47
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So you can make sure only members in your workspace can view it or only certain people can access.

48
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:23,000
If you want to add a password to your video, you'll want to go to More Options and Password Protecting Your Video.

49
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Lastly, we have the Social and Embed button.

50
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The Social button allows you to share across social media, and if you want to embed your video, you can do that here.

51
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And that's everything from me. You are now a Loom expert. High five!

52
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Thanks for recording with us.
