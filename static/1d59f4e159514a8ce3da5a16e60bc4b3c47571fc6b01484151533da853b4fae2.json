My personal favorite and daily recorder is our Desktop app,\n\n3\n00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000\nmainly because it has helpful features like HD recording as well as custom size recording.\n\n4\n00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000\nAlso, can't forget our drawing tool.\n\n5\n00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000\nYou can use our Chrome extension for integrations like Zendesk, Slack, and Gmail,\n\n6\n00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000\nand it's also handy for sharing recordings directly through Chrome.\n\n7\n00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,000\nIf you're recording on the go, you can download our mobile app, which is available for iOS and Android devices.\n\n8\n00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000\nBefore you get started with the Desktop app, you're going to want to take a look at your different capture options.\n\n9\n00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000\nStarting with your camera, so you can see I'm recording with my screen and camera.\n\n10\n00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000\nThis is my preferred method of recording. If you want to record just your screen, you'd select Screen Only,\n\n11\n00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000\nand if you want to record just yourself, you'd select Cam Only.\n\n12\n00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000\nNow, this might seem a bit obvious, but you're also going to want to make sure that your microphone is working.\n\n13\n00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000\nSo you'll have the option to select your microphone here, and one easy way to test that your audio is working\n\n14\n00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000\nis by seeing if the microphone icon is responding.\n\n15\n00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000\nLastly, I wanted to take a minute to point out your preferences,\n\n16\n00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000\nwhich you can find at the upper right-hand corner when you click on these three dots.\n\n17\n00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000\nYour preferences will take you to your settings, which will allow you to turn certain features on and off,\n\n18\n00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000\nlike your default quality when you're recording, as well as your highlight mouse clicks.\n\n19\n00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000\nLastly, your keyboard shortcuts are in here as well, and they are entirely customizable.\n\n20\n00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000\nOnce you're ready to start recording, you'll be prompted by a countdown to help you gather your thoughts.\n\n21\n00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000\nI also want to point out that I'm using our recording canvas, and if you click on your camera bubble,\n\n22\n00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000\nyou'll see the option to select a background and frame. This is my favorite one.\n\n23\n00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000\nThese come in handy if you want to make your video just a bit more engaging or fun.\n\n24\n00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000\nOn the left-hand side, you'll see the recording buttons. First, we have the Restart button.\n\n25\n00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000\nThis comes in handy if you want to quickly restart your video without exiting out of Loom.\n\n26\n00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000\nNext, we have the Pause button, which is another personal favorite feature.\n\n27\n00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000\nThis comes in handy if you want to gather your thoughts without stopping the video entirely.\n\n28\n00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000\nAs you can see, you can pick up right where you left off, and people will be none the wiser.\n\n29\n00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000\nLastly, we have the Cancel button. This is if you want to completely scrap your video and start over.\n\n30\n00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000\nAnd as I showed you earlier, we have the drawing tool, which allows you to highlight things on your screen.\n\n31\n00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000\nOnce you're ready to stop recording, you'll hit the Stop Recording button,\n\n32\n00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000\nand this will take you to the Share page to continue editing your video.\n\n33\n00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000\nOnce you've stopped recording, you'll be taken to the Video Share page,\n\n34\n00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000\nwhere you can make edits and change the privacy settings of your video.\n\n35\n00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:55,000\nThe first thing you might want to do is edit the title of your video to make it a bit more engaging or personalized.\n\n36\n00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000\nIf you look on the right-hand side, you'll also see the option to edit your video preferences.\n\n37\n00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:08,000\nSo this will give you options to turn on comments or emoji reactions, depending on the type of video that you're sending.\n\n38\n00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000\nSay you were recording your video and you made a mistake, or maybe at the beginning you needed to take a breather before getting started.\n\n39\n00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:24,000\nYou can trim your video to make sure it looks as polished as possible before sending it off.\n\n40\n00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,000\nLastly, if you're on the Education, Business, or Enterprise plans, you'll see the options to edit a call to action.\n\n41\n00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:39,000\nThis is great if you want to share a presentation or Google Slides for someone to check out after watching your video.\n\n42\n00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000\nAnd adding a custom thumbnail can also help make your video look a bit more polished.\n\n43\n00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:55,000\nSo now you've finished editing your video, the easiest way to share it with people is to click the Copy Link button here.\n\n44\n00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000\nYou'll be able to share these links with anyone that you want.\n\n45\n00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000\nSay you want to make sure that you have some privacy settings on your video.\n\n46\n00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000\nWhen you click on the Share button, you'll see the options to edit the privacy settings.\n\n47\n00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000\nSo you can make sure only members in your workspace can view it or only certain people can access.\n\n48\n00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:23,000\nIf you want to add a password to your video, you'll want to go to More Options and Password Protecting Your Video.\n\n49\n00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000\nLastly, we have the Social and Embed button.\n\n50\n00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,000\nThe Social button allows you to share across social media, and if you want to embed your video, you can do that here.\n\n51\n00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000\nAnd that's everything from me. You are now a Loom expert. High five!\n\n52\n00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000\nThanks for recording with us.\n\n\n",
